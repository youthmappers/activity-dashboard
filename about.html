      <h1>YouthMappers Activity Tracker</h1>

      <p>This dashboard quantifies the OpenStreetMap editing activity by mappers associated with YouthMappers chapters around the globe. There are over <strong>400</strong> chapters in more than <strong>75</strong> countries around the world. This dashboard shows edits from <strong><span id='distinct_uids'>thousands</span></strong> of mappers in these chapters.</p>    


      <h4 class='pt-2'>Don't see your edits or your chapter?</h4>
      <p>We can only track edits by mappers that are registered or listed in an official YouthMappers chapter on OSM Teams. <a href="#osmteams">Please see the instructions to join your chapter on OSM Teams!</a></p>
    </div>

        <h6>Filtering by Time</h6>
        <p>
          The timeline along the bottom shows the relative number of chapters active each day in OSM. By <code>clicking and dragging</code> across the timeline, the map will filter to only show changesets submitted in that time range.
        </p>
        
        <h6>Changeset Information</h6>
        <p>
          <code>Click</code> <em>Show Bounding Boxes</em> to show the bounding box of changesets performed that day. The bounding boxes appear unstraight because they can also be viewed in 3d!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tilt the map with <code>Control + Click &amp; Drag</code> to see the actual terrain. The numbers inside the bounding boxes represent the number of features edited in that box on any given day. Hovering over this number will give more information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <img class='image img-fluid m-2' src='assets/img/terrain.jpg'>
    

    <h6>Filtering by Chapter</h6>
    <p>
      Choosing a chapter from the Dropdown menu labeled <code>Choose A Chapter</code> will show only edits from mappers associated with that chapter. Multiple chapters can be chosen consecutively. Chapters can be unselected by clicking the<code>[X]</code> button next to their name.
    </p>

    <div class='mt-4' id='how'>
      <h4 class='mt'>How are these numbers calculated?</h4>
    </div>

    <p>Did you know that the entire editing history of OpenStreetMap is available in a queryable database part of Amazon's <a target="_blank" href="https://registry.opendata.aws/osm/">Open Data Program</a>? We search the full history to count all of the edits to highways, buildings, amenities, or other objects by OSM users known to be in, or have been part of a YouthMappers chapter.</p>
    <p>The numbers presented here are just a subset of all edits from YouthMappers chapters because there many mappers associated with YouthMappers chapters that are not yet registered on OSM Teams. If you are part of a YouthMappers chapter and not registered on OSM Teams, <a href="#osmteams">please see the instructions to join your chapter on OSM Teams!</a></p>


    <!-- <h4>Can I download the data?</h4>
    <p>You can download the processed data behind the map as a <a target="_blank" href="data/weekly_chapter_activity.geojson">GeoJSON file here</a> (~20MB). This data is aggregated at the zoom-level 8 map tile, per chapter, per day.</p>

        <h1 class='pt-4' id="">OSM Teams</h1>
      
        <p>OSM Teams is a platform that allows OpenStreetMap users to organize themselves into <em>teams</em>. This allows more convenient tracking of membership among groups of mappers, which enables easier collection of mapping metrics and statistics.</p>

        <h2 class='pt-4'>YouthMappers on OSM Teams</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://mapping.team/organizations/1" target="_blank">YouthMappers Organization</a> on OSM Teams consists of more than 2,200 mappers across more than 300 teams. Each team represents an active YouthMappers chapter. Edits from mappers that are members of these teams are counted on the <a href="https://activity.youthmappers.org">Activity Tracker</a>.</p>
